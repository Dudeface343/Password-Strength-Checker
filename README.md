# Password-Strength-Checker

This is a simple program and tests the strength of a password. Simply type in a password when prompted and it will return a score and rating.

Download the python file and run it from terminal or a python code editor

This is a pretty limited program that won't go super in depth with the strength of the password. In scenarios where someone is using personally identifying information or commonly used words like "password", the program may still consider the password to be pretty strong. It will, however recognize use of characters in sequence such as "abcd" or "1234" as something that contributes to a weaker password. This program was made for educational purposes, it you really need a secure password there are much better alternative online.

Responsible Use: Putting to much faith on the results of this program could result in issues under some specific scenarios. The code could be modified to return misleading responses.
